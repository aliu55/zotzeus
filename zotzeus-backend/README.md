# ZotZeus

## Basic overview

This is the backend for our ZotZeus application, which handles the creation of all the information. The backend was created using a [template](https://github.com/hackuci/zothacks-2020-frontend) provided by a workshop hosted by Hack at UCI.

    ```
3. Run the project without a debugger attached
