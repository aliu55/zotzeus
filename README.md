# Zot Zeus

## ⛈️ Organize your tempestuous life with the power of Zot Zeus! ⛈️

Zot Zeus was built to handle your needs in a virtual learning environment. With the addition of new information and virtual rooms to meet in, your bookmarks bar becomes easily cluttered with Zoom links, Piazza boards, and social media sites. 

If you keep getting lost somewhere in your multiple layers of folders, don’t despair! ZotZeus will make sure that you never lose a precious link ever again. With customizable events and specifications for event times and social links, ZotZeus helps you stay on top of your schedule and saves you precious time on finding your bookmarks (so you can spend a few extra minutes in bed before heading to class).

Built for UCI ZotHacks 2020.
